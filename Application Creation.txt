I am a AWS Cloud DevOps engineer working on a task. Imagine you are me and you have to complete this task. My constraints are that I must use the following AWS technologies:
AWS Lambda, AWS EventBridge, Amazon S3 and AWS SDK for Python
I need to develop an application written in Python. The application must collect metrics from the number and overall size of unattached disk volumes, not ecnrypted disk volumes and not encrypted snapshots and store the metrics as JSON files.
I need help with generating the code for this python application. I also need help with generating infrastructure using python AWS SDK. The following infrastructure must be created:
1 AWS Lambda, 1 EventBridge trigger that will trigger our Lambda function once a day, 1 unattached disk, 2 non-encrypted disks, 3 encrypted snapshots, 1 S3 bucket that will store the result of the python application, IAM Role and permissions attached to that role so that the application may query AWS for needed metrics and store them in S3.
Please split the python files in separate .py files one for setting up infrastructure and one for the main application. Please also give me the commands to setup a new python venv and generate a requirements.txt I should upload.
Please also keep into consideration that I am working under MacOS.
Let me know if you need any clarifying details before you can begin.
ChatGPT

Letâ€™s break this task down step-by-step:

    Environment Setup:

    bash

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv aws-metrics-env

# Activate the environment
source aws-metrics-env/bin/activate

# You will need to install the required packages
pip install boto3

# Generate requirements.txt
pip freeze > requirements.txt

Infrastructure Setup Code (setup_infrastructure.py):

python

import boto3

def create_s3_bucket(bucket_name):
    s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
    s3.create_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name)

def create_disks_and_snapshots():
    ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
    # Create unattached disk
    ec2.create_volume(Size=10, AvailabilityZone='us-west-1a')
    
    # Create non-encrypted disks
    for _ in range(2):
        ec2.create_volume(Size=10, AvailabilityZone='us-west-1a', Encrypted=False)
    
    # Create encrypted snapshots
    for _ in range(3):
        volume = ec2.create_volume(Size=10, AvailabilityZone='us-west-1a', Encrypted=True)
        snapshot = volume.create_snapshot(Description="Encrypted Snapshot")
        # If you want to cleanup and not maintain the volumes, delete them after creating snapshots
        volume.delete()

def create_lambda_role():
    iam = boto3.client('iam')
    trust_relationship = {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [{
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {"Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com"},
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }]
    }
    response = iam.create_role(RoleName='LambdaMetricsRole', AssumeRolePolicyDocument=json.dumps(trust_relationship))
    role_arn = response['Role']['Arn']
    
    # Attach necessary permissions to the role
    policies = ["arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess", "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess"]
    for policy in policies:
        iam.attach_role_policy(RoleName='LambdaMetricsRole', PolicyArn=policy)
    
    return role_arn

if __name__ == "__main__":
    bucket_name = "aws-metrics-bucket"
    create_s3_bucket(bucket_name)
    create_disks_and_snapshots()
    create_lambda_role()

Python Application (app.py):

python

    import boto3
    import json

    def lambda_handler(event, context):
        ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
        s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
        
        unattached_volumes = list(ec2.volumes.filter(Filters=[{'Name': 'status', 'Values': ['available']}]))
        non_encrypted_volumes = list(ec2.volumes.filter(Filters=[{'Name': 'encrypted', 'Values': ['false']}]))
        non_encrypted_snapshots = list(ec2.snapshots.filter(Filters=[{'Name': 'encrypted', 'Values': ['false']}]))
        
        metrics = {
            'unattached_volumes_count': len(unattached_volumes),
            'unattached_volumes_size': sum([vol.size for vol in unattached_volumes]),
            'non_encrypted_volumes_count': len(non_encrypted_volumes),
            'non_encrypted_snapshots_count': len(non_encrypted_snapshots)
        }

        # Save metrics to S3
        bucket_name = "aws-metrics-bucket"
        s3.Object(bucket_name, 'metrics.json').put(Body=json.dumps(metrics))

        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': json.dumps(metrics)
        }

    Deploy the Lambda Function:

    You can zip the app.py file and use AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to create the Lambda function and provide the appropriate IAM role created by the setup_infrastructure.py script.

    EventBridge Configuration:

    Once the Lambda function is deployed, go to the AWS EventBridge console, create a new rule, specify a daily schedule, and set the target as the Lambda function.

Note:

    Ensure that you've specified the right region (us-west-1a is used in the example, but you might have to adjust).
    The above scripts are simplified and may require error-handling, retries, etc. for production use.
    Before executing scripts, ensure you've configured AWS CLI with necessary credentials and default region.
    Always ensure you're not violating AWS service limits or incurring unnecessary costs.
    Ensure that all necessary IAM permissions are in place to run the scripts and functions.
    The Lambda function may need tweaking depending on your deployment method (e.g., if you use deployment packages, layers, or SAM).

How would I run the setup_infrastructure.py file? Should I generate a key pair from AWS IAM to export in environment variables and them pass them somehow in AWS SDK to authorize against AWS to provision these resources?
ChatGPT

Running setup_infrastructure.py involves authenticating against AWS to provision the specified resources. Here's a step-by-step guide:

    Setting up AWS Credentials:

    You should have the AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary access rights. If not:

    bash

pip install awscli
aws configure

This will prompt you for:

    AWS Access Key ID
    AWS Secret Access Key
    Default region name
    Default output format

These credentials will be saved in ~/.aws/credentials and ~/.aws/config respectively.

Alternatively, you can use environment variables:

bash

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your_access_key'
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your_secret_key'
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION='your_region'

Note: Ensure the IAM user associated with these credentials has the necessary permissions to create EC2 volumes, snapshots, S3 buckets, and IAM roles.

Running the script:

Activate your virtual environment if it's not active:

bash

source aws-metrics-env/bin/activate

Execute the script:

bash

    python setup_infrastructure.py

    Authorization:

    When you run AWS SDK commands, it first looks for credentials in environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY). If not found, it will then look for the ~/.aws/credentials file created by aws configure. As such, you don't need to explicitly pass these credentials in your Python code.

Security Best Practices:

    Avoid hardcoding credentials in your scripts or applications.
    Use IAM roles with the least privilege principle. Grant only permissions that are necessary for the tasks.
    Consider using IAM roles for EC2 or other services if running this on AWS services to avoid managing keys.
    Rotate keys regularly and use IAM policies to enforce this.
    Always be careful not to accidentally commit and push AWS credentials to public repositories.

Lastly, when provisioning infrastructure programmatically, consider infrastructure as code tools like AWS CloudFormation or AWS CDK, which provide more structured, maintainable, and repeatable methods of deploying resources.

How would I use my function locally, assume I have setup access to the aws account via environment variables
ChatGPT

If you want to test your function locally, you'd typically make use of AWS's SAM (Serverless Application Model) CLI, which provides a way to test AWS Lambda functions locally. However, since your request is to keep things simple with environment variables and the existing setup, let's go with a straightforward approach.

Given that you've set up your AWS credentials via environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and optionally AWS_DEFAULT_REGION), the boto3 SDK will automatically use these for authentication.

Here's how you can run your Lambda function locally:

    Setup:

    Ensure you're inside your virtual environment:

    bash

source aws-metrics-env/bin/activate

Run the function:

You can create a Python script (e.g., test_app.py) to call the Lambda function handler locally:

python

from app import lambda_handler

# Define a test event (You can modify this as needed to simulate different EventBridge payloads)
test_event = {}

# Define a test context (a mock, since it's only needed if you access context attributes in your function)
test_context = {}

# Invoke the lambda function handler
response = lambda_handler(test_event, test_context)

# Print the response
print(response)

Execute the script:

bash

    python test_app.py

This will invoke your Lambda function handler (lambda_handler) as if it was triggered by AWS EventBridge, but it's running locally using your local Python environment and AWS credentials.

Points to consider:

    This method is a basic way of invoking the function locally. In a more advanced setup, you might want to look into tools like localstack or AWS's SAM CLI for a more accurate emulation of the AWS environment.
    Be careful when running AWS-related operations locally, especially when these operations could incur costs, modify resources, or expose sensitive data.
    If your function interacts with AWS resources, remember that while you're testing locally, the resources it interacts with (like S3, EC2) are real resources on AWS.
    It's always a good idea to have a separate AWS account or separate environment for testing to avoid any unintentional changes to production resources.

User
Which files should I upload to lambda to make this python application usable?
ChatGPT

For your Python application to be usable in AWS Lambda, you need to package the application code and any dependencies together.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

    Activate your virtual environment:

    bash

source aws-metrics-env/bin/activate

Package your application:

Given that your application currently uses only boto3, which is provided by default in the AWS Lambda Python runtime, you technically wouldn't need to package it. However, it's good practice to package it anyway in case you add more dependencies later.

    First, navigate to the directory containing your virtual environment.
    Create a new directory (e.g., lambda_package) where you'll place everything needed for the Lambda function.
    Copy your app.py to lambda_package.
    Next, copy all the necessary packages from the site-packages of your virtual environment to lambda_package.

bash

cp -r aws-metrics-env/lib/python3.x/site-packages/* lambda_package/

Replace 3.x with your actual Python version (e.g., 3.8).

Compress the package directory:

Navigate to where your lambda_package directory is and compress its contents:

bash

    cd lambda_package
    zip -r ../lambda_function_payload.zip .

    Upload to AWS Lambda:
        Go to the AWS Lambda Console.
        Create a new Lambda function or update an existing one.
        In the Function code section, select "Upload a .zip file" and upload the lambda_function_payload.zip you just created.
        Set the runtime to Python 3.x (whichever version you used).
        Set the handler information. If your function is named lambda_handler inside app.py, set the handler as app.lambda_handler.

Some best practices & notes:

    For larger projects with multiple dependencies, you might find it cumbersome to manage and package everything manually. In such cases, tools like the AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) or frameworks like serverless can help streamline the packaging and deployment process.

    It's a good idea to exclude unnecessary files from the Lambda package to reduce its size. AWS Lambda has a limit on deployment package size, which is 50 MB for direct upload through the console and 250 MB when uploaded from S3.

    Always test the function after deploying to ensure that the uploaded code works as expected in the AWS environment.

User
I uploaded only my app.py, which is as follows 
import boto3
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
    s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
    
    unattached_volumes = list(ec2.volumes.filter(Filters=[{'Name': 'status', 'Values': ['available']}]))
    non_encrypted_volumes = list(ec2.volumes.filter(Filters=[{'Name': 'encrypted', 'Values': ['false']}]))
    non_encrypted_snapshots = list(ec2.snapshots.filter(Filters=[{'Name': 'encrypted', 'Values': ['false']}]))
    
    metrics = {
        'unattached_volumes_count': len(unattached_volumes),
        'unattached_volumes_size': sum([vol.size for vol in unattached_volumes]),
        'non_encrypted_volumes_count': len(non_encrypted_volumes),
        'non_encrypted_snapshots_count': len(non_encrypted_snapshots)
    }

    # Save metrics to S3
    bucket_name = "aws-metrics-bucket"
    s3.Object(bucket_name, 'metrics.json').put(Body=json.dumps(metrics))

    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps(metrics)
    }

Via a zip file and set the handler to app.lambda_handler, the lambda function has the needed permissions to list all ec2 objects and all actions within s3 buckets. Could you please help me troubleshoot this error message when running a test with payload '{}' and error message '{
  "errorMessage": "2023-08-14T10:49:08.466Z 7c712ff6-dd1f-4f8c-8073-e00c6109c5e6 Task timed out after 3.04 seconds"
}'in response?
ChatGPT

The error message you're seeing, Task timed out after 3.04 seconds, indicates that your Lambda function took longer than its configured timeout to complete.

Here's how you can troubleshoot and resolve this:

    Increase the Lambda Timeout:

    The first and simplest step is to increase the timeout setting of your Lambda function. By default, the timeout might be set to a short duration (e.g., 3 seconds).
        In the AWS Lambda Console, navigate to the Configuration tab for your function.
        Under General configuration, click Edit.
        Increase the Timeout value. For example, set it to 30 seconds to see if the function completes within that time.
        Save and test the function again.

    Logging:

    It's essential to understand where the function might be getting delayed.

        Introduce logging throughout your function to identify which step is taking time. For this, you can use Python's built-in logging library.

        python

import logging
logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

Add logs at various stages of your function:

python

logger.info("Started querying unattached volumes...")

Then, after the operation:

python

        logger.info("Finished querying unattached volumes...")

        After adding logging, re-upload your Lambda function and run it. Check the logs in AWS CloudWatch to identify which part of your function is causing the delay.

    Optimize Queries:

    If your AWS environment has a large number of resources (volumes, snapshots), fetching all of them might take significant time. Consider optimizing or batching your queries if possible.

    Lambda Memory and Performance:

    The performance of a Lambda function is directly proportional to the memory configured. If you've set a low memory amount, consider increasing it as it will also proportionally increase the CPU power and I/O performance.

    Check Dependencies:

    Although in this specific instance you're using only boto3, it's good to be aware that any external libraries not included in the Lambda runtime need to be bundled with your Lambda function. Missing dependencies can sometimes cause issues, although the error message would typically be different in those cases.

    VPC Configuration:

    If your Lambda function is configured to run inside a VPC, ensure that the VPC has the necessary network configuration (NAT Gateway, VPC endpoints, etc.) to communicate with AWS services, especially if you're accessing services outside the VPC like S3.

After making any of the above changes, re-test your Lambda function and check if the timeout issue is resolved. If not, dive deeper into the CloudWatch logs to understand the bottlenecks.
User
In my outputs I am getting more than three unencrypted snapshots, why may that be, can I update my filter to include values only from 1 region?
ChatGPT

If you're getting more unencrypted snapshots than you expect, there might be a few reasons:

    Default boto3 Behavior: The boto3 library, by default, queries resources from the AWS region that's either set in your environment variables, AWS configuration files, or the default region of the AWS Lambda function (if not explicitly stated in the code). If you have snapshots in that region which are unencrypted, they will be returned.

    Shared Snapshots: Remember that the AWS Management Console and boto3 will list all snapshots that are shared with your AWS account, even if they are not owned by your account. This could be a reason for seeing more snapshots than expected.

    Filtering by Region: If you'd like to specifically filter snapshots from a particular region, you'll need to initialize your boto3 client or resource with that region.

Here's how you can modify your code to specify a region:

python

REGION_NAME = 'us-west-1'  # For example, set to Northern California region

ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2', region_name=REGION_NAME)
s3 = boto3.resource('s3', region_name=REGION_NAME)

In the above code, replace 'us-west-1' with the desired region's code. This will ensure that only resources from that specific region are queried.

Update this in your lambda_handler function, upload the new code to your Lambda function, and then re-run the function. This should now only return the unencrypted snapshots from the specified region.
User
Can I add a filter to filter snapshots that are in completed status
ChatGPT

Yes, you can add a filter to your snapshots query to filter only those that are in the completed state.

In AWS EC2, a snapshot can be in one of the following states: pending, completed, error. To filter only those snapshots that are in the completed state, you would add a filter on the status attribute.

Here's how you can modify your existing code to include this filter:

python

non_encrypted_snapshots = list(ec2.snapshots.filter(Filters=[
    {'Name': 'encrypted', 'Values': ['false']},
    {'Name': 'status', 'Values': ['completed']}
]))

With the above filter, your query will only return snapshots that are both unencrypted and have a status of completed.

Update this in your lambda_handler function, upload the new code to your Lambda function, and then re-run the function to see the filtered results.
User
Could you please add error handling in case the s3 bucket does not exist or it gets a permissions denied message?
ChatGPT

Certainly! You can handle these potential issues using Python's exception handling. boto3 will raise specific exceptions when it encounters errors.

Here's your lambda_handler function with added error handling for S3 bucket-related errors:

python

import boto3
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
    s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
    
    unattached_volumes = list(ec2.volumes.filter(Filters=[{'Name': 'status', 'Values': ['available']}]))
    non_encrypted_volumes = list(ec2.volumes.filter(Filters=[{'Name': 'encrypted', 'Values': ['false']}]))
    non_encrypted_snapshots = list(ec2.snapshots.filter(Filters=[{'Name': 'encrypted', 'Values': ['false']}]))
    
    metrics = {
        'unattached_volumes_count': len(unattached_volumes),
        'unattached_volumes_size': sum([vol.size for vol in unattached_volumes]),
        'non_encrypted_volumes_count': len(non_encrypted_volumes),
        'non_encrypted_snapshots_count': len(non_encrypted_snapshots)
    }

    # Save metrics to S3
    bucket_name = "aws-metrics-bucket"
    try:
        s3.Object(bucket_name, 'metrics.json').put(Body=json.dumps(metrics))
    except s3.meta.client.exceptions.NoSuchBucket as e:
        return {
            'statusCode': 500,
            'body': f"Error: The bucket '{bucket_name}' does not exist."
        }
    except s3.meta.client.exceptions.AccessDenied as e:
        return {
            'statusCode': 403,
            'body': f"Error: Access denied when writing to '{bucket_name}'."
        }
    except Exception as e:
        # Catch any other exception (this is a general exception, so be cautious about using it)
        return {
            'statusCode': 500,
            'body': f"Error: {str(e)}"
        }

    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps(metrics)
    }

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

    We've added a try...except block around the S3 upload code.
    If the bucket does not exist, boto3 raises a NoSuchBucket exception, which we catch and handle by returning an appropriate error message.
    If there's a permission issue, boto3 raises an AccessDenied exception, which we also catch and handle.
    The generic Exception catch is optional and should be used judiciously. It will catch all other exceptions, which might be useful for debugging but might also mask other problems if not logged or handled correctly.

Always be cautious when using broad exception catches, as they can sometimes hide unexpected issues. If you're aware of specific exceptions you want to handle, it's best to catch those specifically.
User
Please filter the filters for non-encypted snapshots to only include private snapshots, not public ones
ChatGPT

To filter out public snapshots and only retrieve private (non-public) snapshots, you can add another filter based on the restorable-by attribute. If a snapshot is public, its restorable-by attribute contains the value all.

Here's how you can modify your existing code to include this filter:

python

non_encrypted_snapshots = list(ec2.snapshots.filter(Filters=[
    {'Name': 'encrypted', 'Values': ['false']},
    {'Name': 'status', 'Values': ['completed']},
    {'Name': 'restorable-by', 'Values': ['self']}  # This will only include private snapshots
]))

With the above filters, your query will only return snapshots that are:

    Unencrypted
    Have a status of completed
    Are private (restorable only by the account that created them)

Make this change in your lambda_handler function, re-upload your updated code to the Lambda function, and then re-run the function to see the filtered results.
User
I got the following exception when adding the filter botocore.exceptions.ClientError: An error occurred (InvalidParameterValue) when calling the DescribeSnapshots operation: The filter 'restorable-by' is invalid
ChatGPT

Apologies for the oversight. My mistake.

You're correct; there isn't a direct restorable-by filter available for the DescribeSnapshots call. Instead, you'll have to filter out public snapshots post-fetching. Here's how you can modify the logic:

    Fetch all the relevant snapshots.
    Iterate through the fetched snapshots and filter out those which have the attribute restorable-by set to all.

Here's how you can modify your existing code:

python

all_non_encrypted_snapshots = list(ec2.snapshots.filter(Filters=[
    {'Name': 'encrypted', 'Values': ['false']},
    {'Name': 'status', 'Values': ['completed']}
]))

# Filter out public snapshots
non_encrypted_private_snapshots = [snap for snap in all_non_encrypted_snapshots if 'all' not in snap.attributes['RestorableBy']]

After this modification, non_encrypted_private_snapshots will only contain private snapshots that are non-encrypted and in completed status.

Update this logic in your lambda_handler function, re-upload your updated code to the Lambda function, and then re-run the function to see the filtered results.
User
Could you please help me modify the policies attached to the lambda functions to only allow access to 1 specific s3 bucket?
ChatGPT

Of course! To grant your Lambda function access to a specific S3 bucket, you need to attach a policy to the IAM role associated with the Lambda function. This policy should allow the necessary permissions (e.g., s3:PutObject, s3:GetObject) specifically for that bucket.

Here's an example policy that gives the Lambda permission to read, write, and list objects in a specific bucket (replace YOUR_BUCKET_NAME with the name of your S3 bucket):

json

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME",
                "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

To attach this policy to the IAM role:

    Navigate to the IAM dashboard in the AWS Management Console.
    Find the role that's associated with your Lambda function.
    Click on "Add inline policy".
    Switch to the JSON tab and paste the above policy after replacing YOUR_BUCKET_NAME with the name of your bucket.
    Review the policy and give it a name.
    Save the policy.

The Lambda function should now only have access to the specific S3 bucket defined in the policy.
